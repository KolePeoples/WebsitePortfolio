    details: 'This is my implementation of the classic game: Lights Out. My implementation is a smaller 3x3 square than the original 5x5. The goal of the game is to turn all the lights on rather than off. Clicking on a cell toggles that cell and each of its immediate neighbors. Can you solve it in the least amount of clicks?'
